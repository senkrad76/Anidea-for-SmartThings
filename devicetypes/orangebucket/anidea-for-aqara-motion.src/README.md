# [Anidea for Lumi Devices](../../../README.md#anidea-for-virtual-devices)<br>Anidea for Aqara Motion
This supports the same Aqara motion sensors as the original 'bspranger' handler, providing both Motion and Illuminance. The sensors do not send inactive reports so the device handler resets motion using a timer. A number of sensors have been used with a sixty second timer for a considerable time without any obvious issue, but as this matches the 'blind' period of the sensors, and SmartThings times aren't particularly precise, it seems better to relax the default period to 65 seconds to avoid any race condition.

During April 2020, the author experienced a considerable number of issues with the motion not being reset, and all the indications were that the timer event simply wasn't being received. For this reason, `active()` and `inactive()` custom commands have been added, matching the names used in the Simulated Motion Sensor, to allow the attribute to be 'reset' to a known state. The `active()` command does not set the timer.
