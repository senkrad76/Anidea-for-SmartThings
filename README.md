# Anidea for SmartThings (Anidea-ST)

A repository of assorted SmartThings bits and bobs that were created for use within the owner's personal SmartThings environment, but hopefully to a standard that could potentially make them useful to others.

**Please be aware that this is very much a personal repository, and so can be subject to the most trivial of changes. However, as a number of users have forked the repository and others may presumably be using it with their IDE, additional branches may now be in use so there is a bit of a buffer. Please stick to the default branch.**

The repository layout is compatible with the IDE for the 'classic' Device Handlers and SmartApps that are written in Groovy. In the absence of any convention, or even consistent terminology, this structure has been extended for Automations using the top level folder 'automations'. Similarly Custom Capabilities come under 'capabilities'.
