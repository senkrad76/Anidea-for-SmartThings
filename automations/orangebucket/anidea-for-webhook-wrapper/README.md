# Anidea for WebHook Wrapper
This is a simple wrapper library, written in good old-fashioned procedural style, to assist development of automations using the WebHook Endpoint approach. It is also useful for REST API clients. It is still in the early stages of development and how far it develops is likely to depend on what the author wants to do with it.  See [Bucket](../bucket/) for a companion example app that demonstrates how to use it.  

It isn't anticipated that anyone would really want to use this wrapper, but seeing stuff written in a naive procedural style may perhaps assist in understanding how apps go together.

*SmartThings are creating SDKs for this sort of thing but seem to be starting out with JavaScript and Java and going all OOP, which isn't the author's cup of tea at all. So largely procedural programming in PHP fits in a niche.*
